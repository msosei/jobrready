# Microservices Health Fix Summary

## Issue
Multiple microservices were showing as "unhealthy" in the Docker Compose environment, preventing proper functionality of the application.

## Root Cause
The docker-compose.yml file was configured with health checks that used curl to test service endpoints, but curl was not installed in several microservice Docker images.

## Services Fixed
The following microservices were updated to include curl installation:

1. **course_recommender** (Port 8119)
2. **diversity_insights** (Port 8115)
3. **document_summarizer** (Port 8116)
4. **mock_interviewer** (Port 8114)
5. **multi_language** (Port 8118)
6. **voice_agent** (Port 8117)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dockerfile Updates
Added the following line to each affected Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Install curl for health checks
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 2. Services Rebuilt
Rebuilt all affected Docker images to include curl:
- course_recommender
- diversity_insights
- document_summarizer
- mock_interviewer
- multi_language
- voice_agent

### 3. Services Restarted
Restarted all services to apply the changes and verify health status.

## Verification
After implementing the fixes, all services now show as "healthy" in the Docker Compose environment:
- ✅ course_recommender (healthy)
- ✅ diversity_insights (healthy)
- ✅ document_summarizer (healthy)
- ✅ mock_interviewer (healthy)
- ✅ multi_language (healthy)
- ✅ voice_agent (healthy)

## Testing
Verified that health check endpoints are accessible:
```bash
# Example health check for course_recommender
curl -f http://localhost:8119/health
```

## Impact
With all microservices now healthy, the application should function properly with:
- All AI microservices operational
- Health checks passing
- Proper service-to-service communication
- Full functionality of premium features

## Next Steps
1. Monitor services to ensure continued health
2. Consider implementing more comprehensive health checks
3. Add error handling and logging improvements to microservices
