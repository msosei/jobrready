# Security Guidelines for MyBrand Job Application Platform

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

### 1.1 JWT Implementation
- Use industry-standard JWT libraries
- Implement proper token expiration (15-30 minutes for access tokens)
- Use refresh tokens with longer expiration periods
- Store tokens securely (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies)

### 1.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define clear user roles (user, admin, premium_user)
- Implement permission checks at both API and UI levels
- Use middleware for centralized authorization checks

### 1.3 Password Security
- Enforce strong password policies
- Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) support

## 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

### 2.1 API Input Validation
- Validate all input parameters using Pydantic models
- Implement length limits and character restrictions
- Use allowlists for acceptable input values
- Sanitize user inputs before processing

### 2.2 Output Encoding
- Encode data before rendering in HTML, JavaScript, or CSS
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Implement proper escaping for different contexts

## 3. Secure Configuration

### 3.1 Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use different environment files for different environments
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use secret management services in production

### 3.2 CORS Configuration
- Restrict origins to specific domains
- Avoid using wildcards in production
- Implement proper preflight request handling

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

### 4.1 Error Messages
- Never expose stack traces or internal errors to users
- Use generic error messages for security-sensitive operations
- Log detailed errors server-side for debugging

### 4.2 Logging Best Practices
- Log security-relevant events (login attempts, failed requests)
- Avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
- Implement log rotation and retention policies

## 5. API Security

### 5.1 Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Use different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated requests
- Consider IP-based and user-based rate limiting

### 5.2 API Versioning
- Version all APIs to allow for security updates
- Deprecate and remove old API versions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## 6. Data Protection

### 6.1 Encryption
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048+)

### 6.2 Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary user data
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Anonymize data when possible for analytics

## 7. Dependency Management

### 7.1 Regular Updates
- Monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Use automated tools like Dependabot or Renovate
- Regularly audit dependencies with `safety` and `npm audit`

### 7.2 Dependency Pinning
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds
- Review and update dependencies regularly

## 8. Frontend Security

### 8.1 XSS Prevention
- Sanitize all user-generated content
- Use DOMPurify or similar libraries
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

### 8.2 CSRF Protection
- Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Implement SameSite cookies
- Validate origin headers for sensitive requests

## 9. Infrastructure Security

### 9.1 Container Security
- Use minimal base images
- Scan containers for vulnerabilities
- Run containers with least privileges

### 9.2 Network Security
- Implement network segmentation
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

## 10. Monitoring and Incident Response

### 10.1 Security Monitoring
- Implement intrusion detection systems
- Monitor for unusual activity patterns
- Set up alerts for security events

### 10.2 Incident Response
- Develop incident response procedures
- Regularly test incident response plans
- Maintain contact lists for security incidents

## 11. Compliance and Standards

### 11.1 OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- Regularly review and address OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Implement security controls for each category

### 11.2 Privacy Regulations
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations
- Implement privacy by design principles
- Provide clear privacy policies and user controls

## 12. Security Testing

### 12.1 Automated Testing
- Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- Perform regular vulnerability assessments

### 12.2 Manual Testing
- Conduct penetration testing annually
- Perform code reviews with security focus
- Engage security consultants for critical features

## 13. Developer Best Practices

### 13.1 Secure Coding Practices
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate all inputs and outputs

### 13.2 Security Training
- Provide regular security training for developers
- Stay updated on latest security threats and mitigations
- Encourage responsible disclosure of security issues
