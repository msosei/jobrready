# Application Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **CORS Configuration Issue**: 
   - Problem: The frontend was running on port 5173, but the backend CORS was configured for port 3000
   - Fix: Updated the APP_URL environment variable in backend/.env to http://localhost:5173

2. **Environment Variable Loading**:
   - Problem: The backend wasn't loading environment variables from the .env file
   - Fix: Added `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables from the .env file

3. **CORS Middleware Configuration**:
   - Problem: The CORS middleware wasn't properly configured to allow requests from the frontend
   - Fix: Ensured the middleware uses the correct APP_URL environment variable

## Changes Made

### Backend Configuration
- Updated [backend/.env](file:///Users/mac/job%20ready/backend/.env) to set APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
- Modified [backend/app/main.py](file:///Users/mac/job%20ready/backend/app/main.py) to load environment variables with `load_dotenv()`

## Services Status

### Backend API
- ✅ Running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ CORS properly configured for http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Job search API accessible
- ✅ Health check endpoint working

### Frontend
- ✅ Running on http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Can successfully communicate with backend API

## Testing Results

- ✅ Backend responds to CORS preflight requests from frontend origin
- ✅ Backend returns job search results when requested from frontend origin
- ✅ No CORS errors in communication between frontend and backend

## Next Steps

The application should now be fully functional. If you're still not seeing anything on your screen:

1. Refresh the browser tab pointing to http://localhost:5173
2. Check the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify that both backend and frontend services are still running

The CORS issue that was preventing the frontend from communicating with the backend has been resolved.
