# Codebase Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve issues across the codebase, including microservices health checks, API functionality, and frontend dependencies.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Microservices Health Check Issues
**Problem**: Multiple microservices were showing as "unhealthy" in Docker Compose due to missing curl for health checks.

**Solution**: 
- Added curl installation to Dockerfiles for 6 microservices:
  - course_recommender
  - diversity_insights
  - document_summarizer
  - mock_interviewer
  - multi_language
  - voice_agent
- Rebuilt and restarted all affected services

**Result**: All services now show as "healthy"

### 2. Job Search API Endpoint
**Problem**: Job search functionality was not exposed as an API endpoint.

**Solution**:
- Added FastAPI router to job_search.py
- Created GET endpoint `/jobs/search` with filtering capabilities
- Updated main.py to include the job search router
- Rebuilt and restarted backend service

**Result**: Job search API is now accessible at http://localhost:8000/jobs/search

### 3. API Keys Configuration
**Problem**: Missing or improperly configured API keys for external services.

**Solution**:
- Created proper environment files (.env, .env.local, config/.env)
- Added VITE environment variables for frontend
- Created comprehensive documentation for API key setup

**Result**: All required API keys are properly configured

### 4. Frontend Dependency Issues
**Problem**: TypeScript errors and missing dependencies in frontend code.

**Solution**:
- Installed frontend dependencies with legacy peer deps flag
- Added missing TypeScript types (@types/react-window)
- Fixed import path issues in frontend code

**Result**: Frontend dependencies are properly installed

## Files Modified

### Backend
- backend/app/job_search.py - Added router and endpoint
- backend/app/main.py - Added job search router import and inclusion
- microservices/*/Dockerfile (6 files) - Added curl installation

### Frontend
- frontend/package.json - Dependency versions
- frontend/.env.development - Environment variables

### Configuration
- .env - Main environment file
- .env.local - Local environment template
- config/.env - Configuration environment file

## Testing Performed

### Microservices Health
```bash
# Verified all services are healthy
docker compose ps
```

### Job Search API
```bash
# Basic job search
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/jobs/search" -H "accept: application/json"

# Filtered job search
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/jobs/search?keyword=engineer" -H "accept: application/json"
```

### Frontend Dependencies
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Services Status

✅ **All microservices**: Healthy
✅ **Backend API**: Running on port 8000
✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 3000
✅ **Job search API**: Accessible and functional
✅ **Health checks**: All passing
✅ **Frontend dependencies**: Installed

## Next Steps

1. Monitor services for continued health
2. Implement additional error handling in microservices
3. Add comprehensive logging to services
4. Consider implementing more advanced health checks
5. Test all premium features to ensure proper functionality
