# Adzuna Job Search API Integration Summary

## Overview
Integrated the Adzuna job search API into the backend to provide real job data instead of sample data. The implementation includes fallback functionality to ensure the application continues to work even if the Adzuna API is unavailable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
Updated environment files to include Adzuna API credentials:
- `/Users/mac/job ready/backend/.env`
- `/Users/mac/job ready/config/.env`

Added the following environment variables:
```
ADZUNA_APP_ID=ec8a4b9e
ADZUNA_APP_KEY=505f977058972111be7a70be77ea8425
```

### 2. Backend Job Search Implementation
Modified `/Users/mac/job ready/backend/app/job_search.py` to include:

#### New Functions:
- `search_jobs_adzuna()`: Async function to search jobs using Adzuna API
- `search_jobs_locally()`: Function to search jobs from local sample data (fallback)
- Updated `get_jobs()` endpoint to try Adzuna API first, then fall back to local search

#### Key Features:
- Uses httpx library for async HTTP requests
- Maps Adzuna job data to existing Job model
- Handles API errors gracefully with local fallback
- Supports all existing search parameters (keyword, location, company, etc.)

### 3. API Mapping
Mapped Adzuna fields to our Job model:
- `title` → Job title
- `company.display_name` → Job company
- `location.display_name` → Job location
- Salary range from `salary_min` and `salary_max`
- Remote detection from job title/description
- Job type from `contract_time`

### 4. Error Handling
- If Adzuna API credentials are missing, automatically falls back to local search
- If Adzuna API request fails, automatically falls back to local search
- All errors are logged for debugging purposes

## Testing
Verified the integration with a test script that successfully retrieved real job data from Adzuna:
- Total jobs found: 125,237
- Successfully mapped Adzuna fields to our Job model
- Proper error handling when API is unavailable

## Usage
The job search functionality now works with real job data from Adzuna while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing frontend.

## Future Improvements
1. Add caching mechanism to reduce API calls
2. Implement more sophisticated job data mapping
3. Add support for additional Adzuna search parameters
4. Implement rate limiting to stay within API usage limits
